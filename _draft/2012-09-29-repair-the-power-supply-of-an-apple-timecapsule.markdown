In the first generation of Time Capsules there was a quality problem with the capacitors in the switching power supply: a lot of them broke due to [heat problems](http://timecapsuledead.org/) after about 17 months There is an excellent [instruction](http://www.appuser.de/?p=392) on how to repair the device. Nevertheless the information which capacitors to use is missing. In this post I present a short instruction including more detailled information on the capacitors.





## Parts List


Four capacitors are to be replaced. They can be obtained from [Conrad](http://www.conrad.de/) (_Best.-Nr. _refers to the Conrad article number, _Teilenummer_ to the manufactor article number).



	
  * 2x 1500µF/6,3V (105°C) Best.-Nr.: 446758 - 62 [Teilenummer: EEUFR1C152B]

	
  * 1x 330µF/35V (105°C) Best.-Nr.: 446911 - 62 [Teilenummer: EEUFR1E331]

	
  * 1x 470µF/6,3V (105°C) Best.-Nr.: 421915 - 62 [Teilenummer: EEUFC1A471]







## Repair the TimeCapsule











	
  1. Remove the rubber

	
  2. Remove the screws

	
  3. Unplug the power supply

	
  4. Open the power supply
**Watch out:** The capacitors will sustain high voltage for months! Make sure to **discharge** them!!

	
  5. Replace the capacitors

	
  6. Make sure the isolation of the power supply is ok.
