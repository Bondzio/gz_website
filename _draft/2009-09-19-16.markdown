Patched for changing the volume of the mpd server from commandline. This is in particular useful, if you want to bind the mpd controls to keyboard shortcuts. Using a simple commandline client for this is not so straight forward, if you want to control several mpd servers; then you would have to keep track to which server sonata is currently connected. Furthermore the last.fm support has been bugfixed.
